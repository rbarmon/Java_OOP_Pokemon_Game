# Java_OOP_Pokemon_Game

This is a Pokemon-themed "rogue-like" game where players can control a character to catch and battle Pokemon. It was created collaboratively using a preexisting game engine as the foundation.

The project aimed to extend the base game's core functionality without altering its codebase, ensuring flexibility. Additionally, it followed the Single Responsibility Principle by assigning specific responsibilities to classes, improving code organization and maintainability.
